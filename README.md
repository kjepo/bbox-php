# bbox-php

The function bbox in `bbox.php` places an image element inside a bounding box (x0,y) -- (x1,y1).

Both `$doc` and `$jpeg` are GDImage elements.

In addition, you can align the image left/right/top/bottom with an optional final argument.  By default this is center.

I plan on writing a sample program when I have more time.
